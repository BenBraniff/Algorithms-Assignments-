    "Your task is to write a backtracking solution to this sort of puzzle. Start small, with a version that does not do anything fancy other than exploring the whole search tree, then try to improve it by finding ways to prune the search tree. Once you have worked out the solution to \"SEND + MORE = MONEY\", for which I give you the solution, apply your code to the following \"THREE + THREE + TWO + TWO + ONE = ELEVEN\". Report the solution and contrast the time to solve both puzzles."

    "Each letter (e.g., S, E, N, D, M, O, R, Y) corresponds to a unique digit (0-9). The only restrictions are that digits assigned must be unique and leading digits (S, M in this case) cannot be zero. We can use recursion to assign digits to one letter at a time. At each step, ensure that the partial solution satisfies all constraints. Our base case would resemble the following: If all letters are assigned and the resulting equation holds true. For example, if all values in SEND + MORE = MONEY hold true, then return the solution. We must make sure that the digits assigned are unique. If the digits are not unique, then the solution is incorrect.  "

    "Completeness\n",
    "The algorithm finds all unique letters in the input and assigns each a digit without repetition. Using backtracking, it explores all possible assignments for these letters. Pruning is applied to improve efficiency by checking letters that are the first character of a word (nonzero constraint) and rejecting assignments that fail intermediate checks. Since the algorithm considers every valid digit assignment within these constraints, it cannot miss a correct solution if one exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Soundness\n",
    "The algorithm makes sure that any solution returned satisfies the cryptarithm equation and all constraints:\n",
    "\t1.\tAfter assigning digits to all letters, it converts each word into a number.\n",
    "\t2.\tIt checks whether the sum of the numbers corresponding to the input words equals the number formed by the result.\n",

    "Conclusion\n",
    "By exploring all possible digit assignments and verifying them against the problem constraints, the algorithm ensures every solution it returns is valid and if a solution exists, it will be found. Therefore, the algorithm is both complete and sound, proving its correctness.\n"
