    "The correctness of the algorithm can be proven by induction on the size of the combination `k`. The algorithm uses backtracking to explore all possible subsets of size `k` from the given array. At each recursive step, it selects one element, reduces the problem to finding `k-1` elements from the remaining array, and continues until `k` elements are selected. Once a subset of `k` elements is formed, it checks if the sum of these elements is zero. If such a subset is found, the algorithm returns it; otherwise, it backtracks and tries other combinations. The base case occurs when `k == 0`, where the sum of the current combination is checked directly. The recursive process ensures that every possible subset of size `k` is explored, guaranteeing that if any valid combination exists, it will be found. If no combination sums to zero, the algorithm exhausts all possibilities and returns `None`, ensuring completeness. Thus, the algorithm correctly finds a combination of `k` elements that sum to zero or determines that no such combination exists."
